Mission objective: complete the quest successfully.

Decision policy:
1. Prefer actions that preserve progress and avoid premature failure.
2. Use Status/context hints (stats, resources, relationships) to reduce obvious risks.
3. If this scene appears repeated, avoid repeating the same action that did not progress.
4. When uncertain, choose the safest reversible action that keeps the mission alive.
5. Do not surrender/quit unless it is clearly required for success.
