{% endfor %}

Goal: maximize chances to complete the mission successfully.
Guidelines:
1. Prefer actions that keep progress alive and gather useful information.
2. Avoid choices that obviously abandon, surrender, or prematurely end the quest.
3. If uncertain, pick the safest non-terminal progress option.
4. Prioritize the core mission objective over optional heroic detours and high-risk side events.
5. Reuse explicit hints from earlier scenes (difficulty, pass/fail conditions) instead of making fresh assumptions.
