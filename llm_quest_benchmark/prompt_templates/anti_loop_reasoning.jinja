Current story state:
{{ observation }}

Available actions:
{% for choice in choices %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ choice.text }}
{% endfor %}

Goal: maximize chance of successful quest completion.

Decision rules:
1. Prefer actions that keep progress alive, reveal clues, or improve resources/relations/stats.
2. Avoid actions that abandon, surrender, flee, or end the mission early unless success is explicit.
3. If current scene feels repeated, prefer a different plausible option than before.
4. Break ties toward reversible low-risk actions that preserve future options.
