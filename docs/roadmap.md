# LLM Quest Benchmark Roadmap

## Core Concept
Enhance **LLM Quest Benchmark** to support advanced agents with memory and tools, using cloud LLMs (Claude, OpenAI, Google), keeping it simple for solo architect (me) and Claude (Sonnet 3.7) as programmer.

## Current Progress

### Completed Features
- ✅ **Agent Configuration Storage**: JSON files in `agents/` directory with standardized schema
- ✅ **Memory System**: Support for both raw message history and summarized history
- ✅ **Tool Integration**: Basic calculator tool implementation
- ✅ **Agent Management Commands**: CLI for managing agent configurations
- ✅ **Web Interface Updates**: Support for memory and tool configuration
- ✅ **Metrics Logging**: Recording completion rates, steps taken, and other metrics
- ✅ **Database Persistence**: Backup/restore system for metrics database

## Next Steps: Leaderboard & Analytics Enhancement

### Phase 1: Unified Run Analytics

1. **Refactor Run Analysis View**
   - Update `/analyze` view to show ALL runs regardless of source (benchmark or manual)
   - Add filtering options by agent, quest, date range, and success status
   - Improve sorting capabilities (by date, steps, reward, etc.)
   - Enhance search functionality to find specific runs

2. **Improve Run Details Display**
   - Add memory usage information to run details
   - Show tool usage statistics when applicable
   - Display timing information for each step
   - Add visual indicators for critical decision points

### Phase 2: Leaderboard Implementation

1. **Create Leaderboard Data Model**
   - Design database tables or views for leaderboard statistics
   - Implement aggregation functions for key metrics:
     - Success rate by agent/model
     - Average reward attained
     - Average steps taken
     - Efficiency metrics (success/step ratio)

2. **Develop Leaderboard UI**
   - Create new `/leaderboard` route and template
   - Implement tabular view with sortable columns
   - Add filtering by benchmark, quest type, date range
   - Include visual elements (charts, badges) for top performers
   - Design responsive layout for mobile/desktop viewing

3. **Add Comparison Features**
   - Enable side-by-side agent comparison
   - Implement statistical significance indicators
   - Add historical trend visualization
   - Create exportable reports for benchmark results

### Phase 3: Enhanced Metrics

1. **Expand Metrics Collection**
   - Track token usage for cost estimation
   - Measure response time for each agent decision
   - Record memory and tool utilization patterns
   - Implement "difficulty rating" for quests based on success rates

2. **Performance Over Time**
   - Track agent improvement across benchmark runs
   - Visualize learning curves for agents with memory
   - Compare performance between agent versions
   - Identify performance patterns and anomalies

3. **Export and Sharing**
   - Add CSV/JSON export for leaderboard data
   - Implement PDF report generation
   - Create shareable links for benchmark results
   - Build public leaderboard option for community benchmarks

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation

1. **Integration Testing**
   - Test leaderboard with various data sets
   - Verify metrics accuracy across different benchmarks
   - Ensure UI responsiveness with large datasets
   - Validate export functionality

2. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation with leaderboard features
   - Create example reports and usage patterns
   - Document new database schema elements
   - Add API documentation for metrics access

3. **Final Refinements**
   - Optimize database queries for performance
   - Add caching for frequently accessed leaderboard data
   - Implement user preferences for default views
   - Fine-tune UI based on user feedback

## Implementation Plan

1. **First Milestone: Unified Run Analytics**
   - Update database queries to include all runs
   - Modify templates to display combined run data
   - Add filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Deploy and test with various run types

2. **Second Milestone: Basic Leaderboard**
   - Implement core leaderboard functionality
   - Create routes and templates for leaderboard view
   - Add top-level metrics (success rate, reward, steps)
   - Deploy for initial user testing

3. **Third Milestone: Comparison and Advanced Features**
   - Add agent comparison capabilities
   - Implement trend visualization
   - Add extended metrics
   - Finalize UI and export options

4. **Final Milestone: Testing and Release**
   - Complete integration testing
   - Update documentation
   - Optimize performance
   - Release final version
