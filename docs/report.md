command: llm-quest run --quest quests/boat.qm --log-level debug

Below is a summary of the debug output from running the boat.qm quest with log-level=debug, followed by an analysis addre
ssing each requested point. The debugging transcript shows the following structure for every “turn” of the quest:

• The game engine prints a “Current Location” panel and a “History” panel, followed by a textual “Observation,” describin
g the quest scenario.
• The engine then shows “Available actions” for the agent to choose from (each labeled with a number).
• The agent is given a prompt containing:
  – The current “Observation” text
  – The “Available actions”
  – A final instruction: “Choose your action (respond with just the number).”
• The agent responds with a single number.
• The quest engine then updates the location and observation based on the agent’s choice, showing a new “Observation” plu
s some new “Available actions.”
• This repeats until the agent either resolves the puzzle or fails.

1) FULL DEBUG LOG (CONDENSED FORMAT)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Below is a condensed version of the most relevant lines from the debug output. It preserves the key parts of each turn bu
t omits some repeated lines. The main repeated logs are the “Prompt,” “Observation,” and “Available actions,” as well as
the agent’s single-number response.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[03:10:43] DEBUG    Debug logging enabled
INFO     Starting quest run with model gpt-4o
DEBUG    Quest file: quests/boat.qm
DEBUG    Timeout: 60s
INFO     Using model: gpt-4o
INFO     Using language: rus

LLMAgent -
Observation:
“У экспедиции … Удачи вам!”
Available actions:
1. Я берусь за это задание

Prompt (after template rendering):
“…
Choose your action (respond with just the number):”

LLMAgent - Raw LLM response: 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
… the quest continues with new “Observation,” new “Available actions.”

LLMAgent sees prompt with short text, chooses an action number. The same pattern repeats:

Observation text → “Available actions: #. <something>” → Prompt → Raw LLM response.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eventually, the puzzle instructions come into focus:
The four gods must cross a “proliv” (channel) with travel times 1 hr, 2 hrs, 5 hrs, and 10 hrs. The boat can hold two god
s, and it always goes as slow as the slowest passenger. The agent has 18 hours total.

The agent tries a sequence of crossing choices by selecting “1,” “2,” etc. The agent repeatedly chooses suboptimal moves,
 resulting in the puzzle failing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the end:

[03:10:54] INFO  Quest failed.
[03:10:54] INFO  Quest run completed with outcome: QuestOutcome.FAILURE
[03:10:54] ERROR Error during quest run:
Exit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus the final lines show that the puzzle was not solved successfully within 18 hours in the story, so the quest ended in
 failure.

2) EXTRACTION & ANALYSIS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Below are the main categories the user requested:

2a) Raw prompts sent to the LLM (after template rendering)
   • Each prompt is a block that begins with “Prompt:” in the logs. The structure is consistent:
     – The “Current observation” text: a mostly narrative chunk describing the last scenario update.
     – The “Available actions” list: each action with a short description.
     – “Choose your action (respond with just the number):” telling the agent exactly how to respond.

   Example snippet from logs:
     ▼
     Prompt:
     Current observation: (… scenario text …)
     Available actions:
     1. (option)
     2. (option)
     …
     Choose your action (respond with just the number):

   • The agent then responds with a single integer, e.g., “1” or “2,” which is captured as “LLMAgent - Raw LLM response:
x.”

2b) Actual choices presented to the agent
   • The quest consistently presents numeric choices, each labeled with a short description. For example, “1. Посадить в
лодку Аха,” “2. Посадить в лодку Вау,” etc. The agent is supposed to pick the correct sequence of crossings to solve the
puzzle within 18 hours.

2c) The agent’s responses
   • The agent’s responses are always single-digit or single-line numbers: “1,” “2,” etc. For example:
       LLMAgent - Raw LLM response: 1

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) TEST OF PROMPT EFFECTIVENESS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3a) Is all necessary context included?
   • The quest logic about the four gods, their crossing times, and the 18-hour limit is presented to the model in the “O
bservation” text. So, in principle, the model sees everything required to solve the puzzle (the crossing times, boat capa
city, speed rules, time limit).
   • The puzzle’s repeated emphasis on “You have 18 hours total” and the list of crossing times is given. So the essentia
l context about the puzzle’s constraints is present.

3b) Are variables properly rendered?
   • The numeric crossing times (1 hour, 2 hours, 5 hours, 10 hours) and the 18-hour total limit are clearly shown in the
 prompts. The instructions about how speed is determined by the slowest passenger are also included.
   • The model sees these as plain text. The relevant puzzle elements appear to be in place.

3c) Is the goal clearly communicated?
   • Yes. The text states the quest ends successfully only if all four gods are on the right bank before 18 hours pass (b
y “утра”). The agent must figure out the minimal crossing strategy.
   • The “time constraint” is repeated multiple times (“…всего за 18 часов…”).

3d) Attempting deeper debug logs or environment variables
   • The shown logs are already at “--log-level debug.” We see each prompt, the entire observation text, plus the agent’s
 response. The quest engine’s prompt is fairly minimal beyond the narrative — it simply enumerates actions and instructs
the LLM to pick one by number.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) CONCLUSION: WHY DID THE AGENT FAIL?
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
From the logs, the agent repeatedly took actions that let the 10-hour traveler cross too early (and come back incorrectly
), or otherwise used suboptimal moves. This quickly consumed more than 18 hours in the story and ended in an in-fiction “
failure.”

• Prompt Construction: The logs show the quest system’s prompts are relatively consistent: they present the scenario and
possible moves; the agent sees everything. So the prompt format is probably not the main failure point. The puzzle data (
times, constraints) is included, so there is not a missing-information error.

• Information Gaps: There is no sign of missing puzzle constraints. The time constraints and crossing times are explicitl
y stated, so the agent has the puzzle data.

• Agent Limitations: The crossing puzzle requires planning. The default LLM approach is to pick the next immediate action
. If it does not reason to find the known minimal crossing pattern (for example, always letting the fastest individuals s
huttle the boat), it can fail. This is a well-known puzzle that requires a precise step-by-step solution. The debug logs
show that the agent made suboptimal moves (e.g., sending the slow ones first without returning the boat cleverly).

Hence the quest’s failure is more about the agent’s strategy than a missing or incorrectly rendered puzzle prompt.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
KEY TAKEAWAYS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The logs confirm the prompt includes the relevant puzzle constraints and instructions.
• The “time limit” is repeated multiple times, so it is clearly communicated.
• The agent’s single-step responses led to an inefficient crossing order, which used up more than 18 hours in the narrati
ve and caused the quest to fail.
• This suggests that the LLM’s chain-of-thought or planning strategy did not correctly solve the logic puzzle, rather tha
n the prompt or context being incomplete.

If you wanted to improve the LLM’s performance, you might:
• Insert more explicit “reasoning scaffolds” into the prompt, encouraging step-by-step or chain-of-thought reasoning so i
t can plan the minimal crossing approach.
• Provide the agent with a short recap of the best-known solution for the 1, 2, 5, and 10 puzzle as “helpful knowledge.”

• Or allow the LLM to make multiple internal reasoning steps before each “action.”

But from the logs, the puzzle was fully described, so the simplest explanation is that the failure stemmed from the agent
’s inability to reason out the minimal crossing strategy in its short turn-based responses.

Next steps
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────



1. Add Reasoning Scaffolds in the Prompt
Why Do This?
The boat-crossing puzzle (1, 2, 5, 10 hours) needs logical planning. By default, the agent just responds with a single digit. Out-of-the-box, many LLMs do not extensively plan from such minimal prompts. By explicitly prompting for reasoning, you give the agent “permission” to do step-by-step analysis.

Sample Prompt Structure
Given a typical quest prompt:

Current observation: "You have 4 gods: A(1h), B(2h), C(5h), D(10h). The boat carries up to 2. …" Available actions: 1. Take A & B across 2. Take A & C across … "Choose your action (respond in JSON)."

You could enrich this with a short “reasoning instructions” block, for example:

[Hidden to user or included lightly?]
"Please think step by step about the puzzle constraints, the minimal crossing known approach, and the time usage. Then produce: { "choice": [the best action number], "reasoning": [short chain-of-thought / explanation] }"

Ensure the final output is strictly JSON, so the quest engine can parse it automatically.

Example Prompt Excerpt

Current observation:
"You must ferry gods across a channel in under 18 hours. Travel times are 1h, 2h, 5h, and 10h, matching the slowest passenger. The boat can hold 2 gods at a time."

Available actions:
1. Bring A & B
2. Bring A & C
3. Bring A & D
4. Bring B & C
5. Bring B & D
6. Bring C & D

INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM:
Think step by step to choose the best action, but output only valid JSON.
Format:
{
  "choice": NUMBER,
  "reasoning": "EXPLANATION"
}

Choose your action:
2. Switch Language to English (lang="eng")
How to Switch Languages
Per the CLI usage from your README.md, you can specify --lang eng when running a quest. For example:


llm-quest run -q quests/boat.qm --model gpt-4o --lang eng --log-level debug
• If you see the puzzle text is still partially in Russian, try providing an English quest file or an English version of the same puzzle.
• If something breaks or the puzzle does not parse fully in English, you can revert to --lang rus as a fallback.

3. Parse Only the Final Answer from the JSON
Why This Matters
If we let the model produce long chain-of-thought text, the quest environment might interpret it as “invalid answer.” By instructing the LLM to produce strictly JSON at the end, we can parse it automatically.

Example Strategies
Regex or JSON Parsing

After the LLM returns something like:

{
  "choice": 1,
  "reasoning": "I realized sending the two fastest first is best to keep crossing times low."
}
The quest engine or your intermediate code can parse the JSON.
Extract "choice": 1 as the numeric action.
The remaining "reasoning" field can be logged or stored but not fed back in the next action if you want to keep the conversation simpler.
Prompt Template

“Your output must be valid JSON. Do not provide extra text or formatting outside of JSON. • 'choice' is the one integer for your final action. • 'reasoning' is your short explanation.”
Check for JSON Validity

If you find the LLM frequently includes extra text, you might wrap the final chain-of-thought in triple-backticks after explaining the rules or add a reminder: “If your JSON is invalid, we’ll ignore it.”
4. Step-by-Step Implementation Outline
Below is a sketch of how you might test and implement this:

Update Your Quest Environment

Adjust the template that generates each turn’s prompt so that it:
• Contains the English puzzle statement.
• Explains how to produce the final format (JSON with "choice" and "reasoning").
• Adds a hint: “Please reason step by step about minimal crossing time, but ONLY output your final answer in JSON.”
Run the CLI

Make sure you specify --lang eng.
Possibly add your new chain-of-thought instructions in the environment or quest code. Example:

llm-quest run -q quests/boat.qm --model sonnet --lang eng --log-level debug
Verify the Output

The debug logs will show the agent’s new JSON-based answers containing "choice" and "reasoning."
For instance:

{
  "choice": 1,
  "reasoning": "We must shuttle the fastest crossing times first."
}
The quest parser can then parse the "choice" field to move the quest forward.
Handling Failures

If we find the LLM is still not following the puzzle logic perfectly, consider adding more scaffolding or even a final hint in the prompt (like “The known minimal solution is 17 hours total, so try to replicate that approach!”).
If you get repeated token-limit or formatting issues, either shorten your chain-of-thought instructions or switch back to Russian if that is more stable.
5. Summary and Next Steps
Chain-of-Thought
Encourage the LLM to “show its work” but keep it enclosed in a “reasoning” key so your quest engine remains stable.
Language
Test with eng to see if the puzzle is solvable with your updated prompt. If you encounter issues, revert to rus.
JSON Output
Provide a strict JSON schema with fields: "choice" (integer) and "reasoning" (string).
Parse the integer for the actual quest move; the "reasoning" is optional diagnostic info.
With this approach in place, your LLM agent is more likely to perform stable, methodical puzzle-solving rather than blunt, single-step guesses. Best of luck with your testing and happy puzzle-cracking!
